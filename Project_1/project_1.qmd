## Elevator pitch

Analyzing and visualizing the names people give their children can give us a glimpse into the cultural and societal trends. By identifying popular names and tracking their popularity over time, we can understand how naming preferences evolve. Furthermore, by analyzing the data, we can uncover patterns in naming trends, such as which names are more popular among specific demographic groups. Overall, data analysis of names can provide valuable insights for various fields including marketing, demographics, and sociology.
