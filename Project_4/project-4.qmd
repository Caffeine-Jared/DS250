## Elevator pitch

_This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a dwelling was built before 1980. By analyzing features such as living area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and whether the property has a basement, the model is able to accurately predict the age of a dwelling. This type of analysis can be valuable to a range of clients, such as real estate investors, city planners, and housing agencies. It can help them make informed decisions about investing in certain areas, identifying neighborhoods that may be in need of rehabilitation, and ensuring that affordable housing is available to those who need it._


```{python}


url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/master/data-raw/dwellings_ml/dwellings_ml.csv'
dwellings_ml = pd.read_csv(url)


alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()
alt.data_transformers.enable('json')
```


## GRAND QUESTION 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980.__


```{python}

sns.scatterplot(x='finbsmnt', y='basement', hue='before1980', data=dwellings_ml)
plt.title('Basement Area vs. Finished Basement Area')
plt.xlabel('Finished Basement Area')
plt.ylabel('Basement Area')
plt.show()

```


```{python}

sns.scatterplot(x='livearea', y='sprice', hue='before1980', data=dwellings_ml)

```


```{python}

sns.scatterplot(x='livearea', y='totunits', hue='before1980', data=dwellings_ml)

```

## GRAND QUESTION 2

__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.__

```{python}

X = dwellings_ml.drop(['before1980', 'parcel', 'yrbuilt'], axis=1)
y = dwellings_ml['before1980']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
                                                    random_state=24, stratify=y)

rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=24)

rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy*100))

```


## GRAND QUESTION 3

__Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a chart and a description of the features.__

```{python}
print(metrics.classification_report(y_pred, y_test))

```




```{python}
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=24)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = rf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred)

roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

roc_display = RocCurveDisplay(fpr=fpr, tpr=tpr, roc_auc=roc_auc, estimator_name='Random Forest')
roc_display.plot()
plt.title('ROC Curve for Random Forest Classifier')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.show()
```

## GRAND QUESTION 4

__Describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics. You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.__

```{python}
df_features = pd.DataFrame(
    {'f_names': X_train.columns, 
    'f_values': rf.feature_importances_}).sort_values('f_values', ascending = False)

(alt.Chart(df_features.query('f_values > .011'))
    .encode(
        alt.X('f_values', axis=alt.Axis(title='Feature Values')),
        alt.Y('f_names', sort='-x', axis=alt.Axis(title='Feature Names')))
    .mark_bar()
    .properties(title='Feature Importances'))
```
